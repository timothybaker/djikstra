It works sometimes, but sometimes it hangs.  I'm pretty sure that the solutions are not the shortest path,
at least not always.  I'm not sure what exactly is wrong but it does usually produce a solution list if there 
is a solution. The algorithm was based on the algorithm from class.

Sorry for the lack of comments and partitioning in the code!


Solution path is saved to 'djikstra_solution.txt'

An ordered list of all nodes and their connections is saved to 'djikstra_nodes.txt'


The files are overwritten on each run of the program if left in the local directory.
